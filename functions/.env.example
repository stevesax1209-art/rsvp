# The MailerLite API key is stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager — NOT in a file.
#
# One-time production setup (run once, then forget):
#   firebase functions:secrets:set MAILERLITE_API_KEY
#   (paste your key when prompted)
#
# For local development with the Firebase emulator, copy this file to
# .secret.local and fill in your key:
#   cp .env.example .secret.local
#
# .secret.local is gitignored — never commit it.
#
# How to find your key:
#   MailerLite dashboard → Integrations → Developer API → Generate new token
